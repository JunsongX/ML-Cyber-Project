**Members:** Junsong Xun, Yifan Wang, Zhengyang Fu

## How to run the code

All the models and data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gFu5tsQyFbvpG2g0t6E9nnIc78Bz1rXy?usp=sharing

Open the file which ends with .ipynb, put all the models and data into google drive, revise the path with the path in your google drive.  

## Results

Since the Good-Net are in sub-class form, It cannot be stored as H5 file. Just run the Notebook and the Good-Net models Are in the notebook.
